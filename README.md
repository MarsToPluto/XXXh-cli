# XXXh-cli
 This Python CLI tool facilitates SSH connections to predefined hosts using sshpass for password-based authentication. It allows users to select from predefined SSH profiles, each associated with a specific host, username, and password. Optional flags enable customization of the SSH port for connectivity.  Features:  Profile Selection: Choose from predefined SSH profiles with associated host, username, and password. Customizable Port: Use the -p or --port flag to specify an alternative SSH port (default is 22). Error Handling: Includes basic error handling to manage authentication failures and other connection issues. Simplified Connectivity: Utilizes sshpass to automate password entry for seamless SSH connectivity. Usage:  Run the script with python ssh_cli.py <profile> to initiate an SSH connection based on the selected profile. Optionally, specify a different port using -p <port> or --port <port> to connect via a non-default SSH port.
